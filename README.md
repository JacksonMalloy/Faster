## Greetings! 

This is a project I've iterated on over the past few years.
What you are looking at is a menu marketplace application where users can set up accounts, menus, items, choices, to display products and services online dynamically for their customers. 

Faster is an old version of the project that was taken public to show some of my more recent work in web architecture. 
There is another iteration of the project that is currently being rolled out in private (not yet in beta).

You can view that project live here: cloudcart.vercel.app

Keep in mind that it is still a work in progress and is currently only meant to be viewed on mobile devices.
